# YAY first blog post!

## First lesson learnt: name it with ".md". 
If you can't tell, I'm not super sure how the blog works yet - I originally didn't even give this file a file extension (yikes). I am hoping to get some blog posts going and become familiar with how the blog works with a little bit of time.  That also probably means that I won't make it pretty until a couple of posts later. 
Update 1:  Look at that I just worked out how to make the text wrap woohoo!
Update 2: I don't like how I have no spell check at the moment - potentially something to fix

## Getting on with FastAI
I am pretty comfortable with the FastAI stuff at the moment. I have gone through a couple of examples last week and have also watched one of the lectures on it and have an okay grasp on it.(*) 

I have begun working on the second question which is quite straight forward implementation wise. It is very similar to the first FastAI example and have so far had very few problems. 
## Git
Setting up the repos wasn't super difficult and the only challenge I have had so far is with the codespaces. 
Initially I did not want to use the codespaces because it felt a bit funny coding in chrome but after doing some more work, I can see that itâ€™s quite a bit quicker, and everything seems to run a bit smoother as well.
## Conclusions

Thats all for right now, bye!
